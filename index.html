                <figure><img src="images/drivers/lewis.jpg"></figure>
                <p>Mercedes</p>
                <p>Biography</p>
                <br>
                <p>Few drivers have entered Formula 1 racing with as big a bang as Lewis Hamilton, whose sensational maiden season in 2007 - in which he lost out on the world championship by a single point - remains one of the most remarkable rookie campaigns in history.<br><br>

Hamilton attributes much of his success to his humble upbringing in Stevenage, the English town in which he began racing as a hobby. Winning came naturally to the young driver and soon he was cutting his teeth in national events. By the age of 10 - with a little less than two years’ experience - he was crowned the youngest-ever winner of the British Cadet Kart championship.<br><br>

Equipped with an assured racing style that belied his years, it wasn’t long before Hamilton’s trophy cabinet was groaning under the weight of more karting titles. Hamilton made sure that Ron Dennis was one of the first to notice his swift rise through the ranks and in 1998 the McLaren boss signed him to the team’s young driver programme. Indeed, Dennis’s belief in Hamilton’s talents was such that the contract even included an option on the 13 year-old should he ever make it into Formula 1 racing.<br><br>

At this stage, however, it was McLaren’s financial support that proved the bigger blessing for Hamilton, who up to that point had been supported by his dutiful father - and future manager - Anthony, who worked several jobs to keep his son racing. At once able to compete on a much larger stage, Hamilton Jnr won a multitude of European karting titles with ease. And by the age of 15 he was grabbing further headlines, this time for being crowned the sport’s youngest number one - a record he still retains...</p>

                <p>Biography</p>
                <br>
                <p>A tour de force as he swept to four straight world championship crowns and countless Formula 1 records, Sebastian Vettel’s relentless hunger for victory, as much as his outstanding talent, secure his place as one of the sport’s greats.
<br><br>

By his mid-20s he was already the dominant driver of his era, becoming the youngest polesitter, winner and champion in history. A second, third and fourth crown, won with either remarkable tenacity or crushing supremacy, only added to his glittering legacy.<br><br>

The foundations for such a remarkable trajectory were laid early on. Vettel had been racing for more than a decade even while still a teenager, having started his career in 1995 at a local kart track in his native Germany, where he had been born in Heppenheim on July 3, 1987. It wasn’t long before he had notched up several regional championships, and bigger things beckoned. Tiring of the local competition, he began to race on a European level. <br><br>

Before long he’d won the region’s junior kart title and even clinched victories at prestigious annual events in Monaco and Paris-Bercy. As he began to make a name for himself, Vettel attracted the attentions of Red Bull, who swiftly signed him up to their young driver programme in 1998.<br><br>

With Red Bull’s backing, Vettel continued to perform well and in 2000 was invited to join the Austrian drinks company’s junior team. Two seasons of karting later - still aged just 15 - he was ready to make the switch to single-seaters. Debuting in the hugely-competitive Formula BMW series in 2003, Vettel faced a tough challenge, but he didn’t disappoint, scoring five wins and ending the season second in the championship...</p>

                <p>Red Bull Racing</p>
                <p>Biography</p>
                <br>
                <p>"If you want to be successful at anything in life the primary thing is you have to enjoy it”. Those were the words of the ever-smiling Daniel Ricciardo as he reflected on his breakthrough 2014 season with Red Bull Racing - a season which saw the affable Australian not only win his first Grand Prix (and two more) but also leave four-time world champion team mate Sebastian Vettel trailing in his wake.<br><br>

Born in Perth in 1989, Ricciardo started karting aged just nine after finding a hero in Ayrton Senna. After working his way through the go-kart ranks, in 2005 he entered the Australian Formula Ford series and, although driving an uncompetitive car, made enough of an impression to secure a scholarship for the following season’s Formula BMW Asia championship.<br><br>

Claiming two wins and 10 podiums in his debut Formula BMW campaign with the Eurasia team, Ricciardo made an instant impression and finished third in the championship. He also enjoyed an outing in the British Formula BMW series, taking three points from two races, and another outing at the end-of-year World Finals, where he finished fifth.<br><br>

In 2007 he switched to Italian Formula Renault, ending the season sixth, scoring a solitary podium in Valencia. And although he gleaned nothing from four additional outings in the European championship that year, he was determined to do better in 2008 and signed up for a second European season, alongside a ride in the Formula Renault Western European Cup. The latter brought him his first sporting title, thanks to eight wins from 15 races.<br><br>

Already a signed-up member of the Red Bull junior team, Ricciardo progressed to the prestigious British Formula Three championship in 2009 and set about proving that his Formula Renault success wasn’t a one-off. Six poles and six wins later - and with two rounds still to run - he won his second championship in as many years...</p>

                <p>Ferrari</p>
                <p>Biography</p>
                <br>
                <p>"He’s a man of few words,” Jenson Button once said of Kimi Raikkonen, “but he's all about racing." Never the most loquacious out of the car, the mercurially-talented 2007 world champion has always preferred to let his driving do the talking, be that in a rally car, on a snowmobile, or, most successfully, in Formula 1 machinery. <br><br>

Widely regarded as one of the finest drivers of his generation, Raikkonen’s path to the top of F1 racing began in his hometown of Espoo in southern Finland when, as a sports-mad 11 year-old, he took up karting. The young racer swiftly stamped his authority on the local opposition before making his mark in international events. Surprisingly, he never won a karting title, but his early racing days singled him out as a future star.<br><br>

In 2000 - ten years after he had first got behind the wheel of a kart - Raikkonen made the switch to single-seaters. Choosing the UK Formula Renault series as his springboard, the previously title-less driver took the championship with seven wins, 316 points and six pole positions. Indeed, the Finn was so dominant that year, several Formula 1 teams, convinced of his raw talent, began to court him.<br><br>

Sauber were the first to make a concrete offer and after a successful three-day test, Raikkonen surprisingly landed a race drive with the Swiss squad for 2001. Given that he had only 23 single-seater race starts to his name, many questioned team boss Peter Sauber’s decision, but from the outset Raikkonen’s pace and consistency blew such criticisms out of the water. He ended his first Formula 1 season with nine championship points - and the admiration of much of the paddock, including, most notably, McLaren's Ron Dennis...</p>

			<h3>FEATURE: Why rapid Haas have ruffled feathers</h3>
            <br>
			<p>The Haas VF-18 is an impressive machine. Early indications suggest it is the fourth best on the grid. That’s cause for celebration for F1’s lone American team, but as Lawrence Barretto explains, some of their rivals aren’t sharing their joy…
            <br>
